# Library Management System Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview and documentation of a simple Library Management System (LMS) implemented as a desktop application using the Tkinter library in Python. The system allows users to manage a collection of books, issue books to users, view issuance history, and delete books. The LMS stores book information in a SQLite database and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the data.

## Features

1. **Add Books**:
   - Users can add new books to the library by providing details such as book name, author name, quantity, and date added.

2. **Issue Books**:
   - Users can issue books to library members.
   - They need to select a book from the list, enter the user's name, roll number, email, and issue date.
   - The issued books are recorded in the database.

3. **View All Books**:
   - Users can view the complete list of books in the library.
   - The list is displayed in a table format, including book details such as book name, author name, quantity, and date added.

4. **View Issuance History**:
   - Users can view the history of book issuances.
   - The issuance history includes book name, user name, roll number, email, and issue date.

5. **Delete Books**:
   - Users can delete books from the library.
   - They select a book to delete from a list of available books.
   - The selected book is removed from the database.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- Tkinter (usually included in standard Python distributions)
- tkcalendar (for the date input widget) # pip install tkcalendar
- SQLite3 (for the database)

## Application Structure

The application consists of a single Python script, which includes the following key components:

1. **SQLite Database**:
   - The SQLite database named `Database_collection.db` is used to store two tables: `books` and `book_issues`. The former stores information about books in the library, while the latter tracks book issuances.

2. **GUI Window**:
   - The main application window is created using Tkinter and styled using the ttk (Tile themed Tkinter) module.
   - The window's appearance includes a background color of "lightblue."

3. **Database Connection and Cursor**:
   - A connection to the SQLite database is established, and a cursor object is created to interact with the database.

4. **Database Tables**:
   - Two tables, `books` and `book_issues`, are created in the database if they don't already exist. These tables store book information and book issuance records, respectively.

5. **Book Management Functions**:
   - Functions like `add_book()`, `issue_book()`, and `delete_book()` allow users to perform corresponding actions on the library's book collection.

6. **View Functions**:
   - `view_all_books()` and `view_issuance_history()` provide functionality to view all books and book issuance history, respectively.

7. **Widgets and Labels**:
   - The application window includes labels, entry fields, combo boxes, buttons, and treeview widgets for interacting with book data.

8. **Styling and Success Messages**:
   - The application uses ttk style and displays success messages to indicate the results of user actions.

## Usage

To run the Library Management System:

1. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed.
2. Run the Python script provided in your preferred Python environment.
3. The GUI window for the Library Management System will open.

## Conclusion

The Library Management System provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing a library's collection of books, issuing books to users, viewing the history of issuances, and deleting books as needed. It is a basic example of how a library management system can be implemented in Python, and it can be extended and customized for specific library needs.
